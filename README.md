This is a basic implementation of a personal financial budget tracker in Python using the matplotlib library for creating pie charts and csv module for exporting data to a CSV file. This implementation allows you to input your expenses, displays a pie chart showing the distribution of expenses, and exports the expenses data to a CSV file.I added functions for loading expenses from a CSV file, analyzing expenses (total expenses, highest/lowest expense category), editing expenses, and deleting expenses.
Expenses are loaded from the CSV file at the beginning of the script, and new expenses are recorded during the execution.
After recording and updating expenses, the script displays a pie chart of expenses, exports the updated expenses to a CSV file, analyzes the expenses, allows the user to edit and delete expenses, and then displays the updated pie chart and exports the final expenses to a CSV file again.
