# website-Update-Automation
This script defines a function scrape_articles(url) that takes a URL as input, sends a GET request to that URL, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the webpage. It assumes that article titles are wrapped in <article> tags and each article has a <h2> tag containing the title. It then extracts the titles and returns them as a list.

In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, the script prompts the user to input the URL of the website to scrape. It then calls the scrape_articles() function with this URL and prints out the article titles if any are scraped.

The fetch_and_print_updates function is responsible for scraping articles from the given URL and printing the titles.
We initially call fetch_and_print_updates to perform the first scraping.
We schedule the fetch_and_print_updates function to run every hour using schedule.every().hour.do(fetch_and_print_updates, url).
The script runs an infinite loop, checking if there are any scheduled tasks to run and sleeps for 1 second between iterations to prevent excessive CPU usage.
With this setup, your scraping script will automatically run and fetch updates from the specified URL every hour. You can adjust the scheduling interval as needed.
